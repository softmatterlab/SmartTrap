This file specifies which packages are needed to run the optical tweezers gui and
for what functions they are used. In certain cases a specific version of the package
 is needed, then it is noted in the comment.
Need the following packages:

- pythonnet - version < 3 Suggest version 2.5.2, installed before installing clr. Note this is needed for thorlabs motors 
and requires python version 3.8 or earlier. Install with "pip install pythonnet==2.5.2" 
- numpy - Saving,storing and manipulating data
- pyqt6 - GUI
- pyqtgraph - GUI oscilloscope functions
- opencv-python - For writing videos
- sk-video - Videos, certain formats
- pypylon - Basler cameras
- nicelib - Thorlabs cameras in python.
- Instrumental-lib - Python instruments
- Pillow - Image management, saving pictures
- pyserial - Interface with serial communications with controllers
- pywin32 - Certain thorlabs cameras needs this
- matplotlib - visualization in some widgets
- scikit-image - threshold tracking, installed with pip install scikit-image
- torch - Deep learning tracking
- torhvision - Deep learning tracking
- ultralytics - YOLO tracking(best option for real-time tracking)
- clr

To use also thorlabs scientific cameras uncomment the import in OT_GUI.py and 
run "pip install thorlabs_tsi_camera_python_sdk_package.zip", file located in Main branch\Suporting Software\Scientific Camera Interfaces\SDK\Python Toolkit
This can also be downloaded from the thorlabs website

Cupy is usefull, installed it with the following command.
conda install -c conda-forge cupy cudatoolkit=11.3
# Make sure to check which cuda version you have before installing!
