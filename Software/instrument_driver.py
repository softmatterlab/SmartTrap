This file defines the classes needed to communicate with the instrument.

Classes

- InstrumentDriver: An abstract class which defines an interface for drivers for optical tweezers
instruments.
- InstrumentControllerThread: A thread which runs in the background and uses an InstrumentDriver
to sample data from the opticalt tweezers instrument.
